**Recurrence Relations**
Definition: A second order homogeneous linear recurrence relation is a relation of the form $a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + c_2a_{n-2}$ for all $n\geq2$.

Characteristic equation: $x^2 - c_1x - c_2 = 0$.
Theorem: If $r_1,r_2$ are distinct solutions to the characteristic equation $x^2-c_1x-c_2 = 0$, then $\exists$ constants b,d such that $a_n = br^n_1 +dr_2^n$.

Final case: The theorem about the characteristic equaition applies when it has two distinct roots, which is not always the case.

For a single root: $a_n = br^n +dnr^n$ 

**Discrete Probability**
Experiment: a process by which we produce a random outcome.
Sample space: the set of all possible outcomes $\Omega$.
$\Omega$ is finite.
Probability function: a function that assigns probabilites to outcomes.
P: $\Omega$ $\rightarrow$ $[0,1]$ = $\{x\in R | 0\leq x \leq 1\}$, such that $\sum P(x) =1$.
