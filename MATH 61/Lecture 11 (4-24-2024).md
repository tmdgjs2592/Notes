**Permutation**
Let $X$ be a finite set $\{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}$. Permutation of $X$ is an ordering of the elements of $X$.
*Permutation of $X$ is a bijection $X \rightarrow X$*

**Theorem**
If $|X| = n$, there are $n!$ permutations of $X$.
Proof: Multiplication principle

What if we want to order k elements from a set with size n?
**K-permutation**
An ordering of k elements among n element 
If we let P(n,k) denote the number of k-permutation of an n-element set,
$$ P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$
K distinct elements without specified order?
In other words how many subsets $S \subset X$ satisfy $|S| = k$?
**N Choose k**
$n \choose k$ or $C(n,k)$: number of subsets of an n-element set which have cardinality equal to k.
$${n\choose k} = |\{S = \subset X | |S| = k\}|$$
*Remark: $n\choose k$ is often referred to as a binomial coefficient* : $(x+y)^n = \sum ^n _{k=0} {n\choose k} x^n y^{n-k}$ 

**Theorem**
$${n \choose k} = \frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac {P(n,k)}{k!}$$
