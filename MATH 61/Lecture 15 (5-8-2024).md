Ex) Prove that for any integer $n>0$, 1+2+3+ $\dots$+n = $n+1 \choose 2$.
Proof: 
Consider n+1 people with distinct ages in an increasing order $p_1, p_2,p_3, \dots, p_{n+1}$ and I would like to form a committee of 2. The number of ways to form a committee of 2 out of $n+1$ people is $n+1\choose 2$. 
Say to form a committee by ages. 
$\#$ of committees where $p_1$ is the oldest is 0
$\#$ of committees where $p_2$ is the oldest is 1
$\#$ of committees where $p_3$ is the oldest is 2
$\vdots$ 
$\#$ of committees where $p_{k+1}$ is the oldest is k
$\therefore$ $\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k-1$ committees.

**Binomial Theorem**
Consider the expression $(x+y)^n$, $x,y$ are real numbers. Then,
$$(x+y)^n = \sum^n_{k=0} {n\choose k}x^{k}y^{n-k}$$
