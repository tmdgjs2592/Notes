**Cycle**
1. It has nonzero length
2. $v_0 = v_n$
3. There are noe repeated edges in the path

**Euler cycles**
Ex: bridge problem
def: A cycle in a graph G is an euler cycle if it contains every edge and every vertex of G.
Equivalently:  A cycle in a graph G is an euler cycle if it contains every edge and G is connected.
$\rightarrow$ containing every edge means that you will contain every vertex.

Ex: ($v_1$, 1, $v_2$, 2, $v_3$, 3, $v_4$, 4, $v_5$, 5, $v_3$, 6, $v_1$)
Although $v_3$ has been visited twice, it is still an euler cycle since it visits each edge exactly once, and all vertices are contained.

Theorem
A graph G has an euler cycle if and only if G is connected and every vertex has positive even degree.

Proof:
1. Prove that if G has an euler cycle, it is connected and every vertex has positive even degre
2. Prove that if G is connected and every vertex has positive even degree, then G has an euler cycle.

Hamiltonian
Def: A cycle in a graph G is called Hamiltonian if it contains every vertex exactly once, except for the beginning vertex which it contains twice.

Lemma: Suppose G contains a Hamiltonian cycle C. Let G' be the subgraph of G which contains all of the edges and vertices in the cycle C. The G' is connected, and all of its vertices have degree 2.
