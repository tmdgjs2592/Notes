**Counting method cont**
Ex)
Suppose we have a 6x6 grid.
How many paths from (0,0) to (6,6) are there if at each step we can either go one unit up or one unit to the right?
Sol: There are $12C6$ paths. There are 12 steps total and we need to determine the path. we can just choose which steps are to the right, the rest will be up.

Ex)
How many 8-bit strings contain at least 5 1's? 
ans:
$${8 \choose 5} + {8 \choose 6} +{8 \choose 7} + {8\choose 8}$$
*These 4 sets are pair-wise disjoint so addition principle applies*

Ex)
Suppose we have a group of 6 students, and we would like to put them into 3 unordered groups of 2. How many ways can we do this ?
3 ordered groups of 2:
$${6\choose 2}{4\choose 2}{2 \choose 2}$$
However, we do not care about ordering. Therefore, divide that by number of ways to order 3 groups.
$${6\choose 2}{4\choose 2}{2 \choose 2} \cdot \frac{1}{3!}$$
Observe: the previous question equivalently can be phrased: how many partitions of a 6 element set have 3 parts, all of size 2?

Ex)
How many different strings can be formed using all of the letters in Mississippi?
1. Choose where to put s: $11\choose 4$ 
2. Choose where to put i: $7 \choose 4$
3. Choose where to put p: $3 \choose 2$
4. Choose where to put m: $1 \choose 1$ 
Ans: ${11\choose 4} {7 \choose 4} {3 \choose 2} {1 \choose 1}$
Theorem:
Suppose we have a list S of n items with $n_1$ items of type 1, $n_2$ items of type 2, ..., $n_t$ items of type t.
Then, there are $\frac{n1}{n_1!n_2! \dots n_t!}$ total orderings of S.
