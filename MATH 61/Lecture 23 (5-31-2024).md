**Euler vs Hamiltonian**
- Euler:
	- contains every edge and vertex. (contains edge exactly once)
	- exists in G, G is connected and every vertex has positive even degree
- Hamiltonian
	- contains every vertex exactly once except for beginning/end vertex.

Ore Criterion
Let G be a graph with |V(G)| = n. We say G satisfies the Ore criterion if for any pair of distinct vertices $v,w \in V(G)$, either v and w are connected by an edge or $\delta(v) +\delta(w) \geq n$. 

Theorem
If G is a simple graph with |V(G)| $\geq$ 3, and G satisfies the Ore criterion, Then G contains a Hamiltonian cycle.

Corollary
Suppose G is a simple graph with |V(G)| = n $\geq 3$. Then if $\delta(v) \geq \frac{n}{2} \forall v \in V(G)$, then G contains a Hamiltonian cycle.

Ore criterion is a sufficient condition to contain a Hamiltonian cycle, but it is not necessary.

**Representing graphs: adjacency matrices**
def: Suppose G is a graph with |V(G)| = n. Fix some ordering of the n vertices: $v_1,v_2,...,v_n$. The adjacency matrix of G w.r.t this ordering is the nxn matrix A whose ij-entry is equal to the number of edges between $v_i$ and $v_j$ if i$\neq$j, and is equal to twice the number of loops at $v_i$ if $i=j$.

Lemma: Let G be a graph with adjacency matrix A. Then,
1. All entries of A are nonnegative integers
2. A is a symmetric matrix: $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$
3. all of diagonal entries are divisible by 2
4. The sum of the entries in the ith row is equal to $\delta (v_i)$.

Lemma: A matrix A with nonnegative integer entries is the adjacency matrix of some graph if and only if it is square, symmetric, and all of the diagonal entries are divisible by 2.

Def: Let G and G' be graphs. An isomorphism $f: G\rightarrow G'$ is the data of bijections $f_v: V(G) \rightarrow V(G')$ and $f_E: E(G) \rightarrow E(G')$ such that $f_E(e)$ is incident to $f_v(v)$ and $f_v(w)$ in G' if and only if e is incidnt to v and w in G. We say G is isomorphic to G' if $\exists$ an isomorphism $f:G\rightarrow G'$.
