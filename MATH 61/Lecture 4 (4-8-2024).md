**Product of sets**
Def: $A \times B = \{ (a,b) | a \in A, b \in B\}$
Example:
Given, $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B = \{red,black\}$
$A \times B =$ {{1,red}, {1,black}, {2,red}, {2,black}, {3,red}, {3, black}}
*When A = B $\rightarrow$ $A^2 = A\times A$ 

Theorem: If A and B are finite sets, $$|A\times B| = |A| \cdot |B|$$
Special case: $|A^n| = |A|^n$ 

# Function
function f: A$\rightarrow$B is a rule which assigns a $\in$ A exactly one element to $f(a) \in B$ 
A is called domain of f and B is called codomain of B
*functions can be specified by arrow diagrams or by a formula*
**Preimage**
Given f: A $\rightarrow$ B and an element  b $\in$ B , the preimage of f is $$f^{-1}(b) =  \{a \in A | f(a) = b\}$$
*Notice this is a subset of A*
Given a subset S $\subset$ B, $$ f^-1(S) = \{a\in A| f(a) \in S \}$$
**Image**
Given an element $a \in A$, the image of a is$$f(a) \in B$$
Given a subset $S \subset A$, the image of S is $$ f(S) = \{b \in B | b = f(a) , a\in S\}$$
