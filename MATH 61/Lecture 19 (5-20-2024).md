**Independence of events Cont**
Ex) Suppose we roll a fair 6-sided die 8 times. what is the probability of seeing the face 1 exactly 3 times ?
Ans: $P(E) = {8 \choose 3}(\frac{1}{6})^3(\frac{5}{6})^5$ 
Think of this experiment as flipping a coin 8 times with probability $\frac{1}{6}$ of heads and probability $\frac{5}{6}$ of tails.
