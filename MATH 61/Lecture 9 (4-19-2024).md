**Partition (cont)**
Theorem: 
Suppose $R$ is an equivalence relation on a set $X$. Then, the set $\mathscr S$ ={$[x]$| $x \in X$ } forms a partition of $X$.
Proof: 
$$
\begin{align}
	&\text{1. Show each $[x]\in \mathscr S$ is nonempty} \\
	&\text{2. If $[x] \neq [y]$, then $[x] \cap [y] = \varnothing$} \\
	&\text{3. For all $x \in X$, there exists some $[z] \in \mathscr S$ such that $x \in [z]$}
\end{align}

$$
Theorem: 
Let $\mathscr S$ be a partition of $X$. Define a relation $R$ on $X$ by a R b if a and b belong to the same member of $\mathscr S$. Then, R is an equivalence relation.

# Basic Counting Principles
**Multiplication principle**:
Suppose X is a set and every element of $X$ can be uniquely specified in k steps, where there are $n_1$ choices for the first step, $n_2$ for the second, $...$ , $n_k$ choices for the kth step. Then, $|X| = n_1\cdot n_2 ... \cdot n_3$.
