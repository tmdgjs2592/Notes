**Partition (cont)**
Partition of $X$ can be $X$ itself.
Ex)
Given $X = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$, $J = \{X\}$ is a partition of $X$.

Key fact:
Let $X$ be a finite set, and suppose that $\mathscr {S} = \{A_1, \dots , A_2\}$ be a partition of $X$.
Then, $|X| = \sum^{n}_{i=1} |A_i|$  

**Equivalence Class**
Suppose $R$ is an equivalence relation on X. Given $x \in X$, we define the equivalence class $[x]$ of $x$ to be the set $[x] = \{y \in X | \text{y R X}\}$ $\subset X$.

**Theorem**
Suppose $R$ is an equivalence relation on a set $X$. Then, the set $\mathscr {S}=\{[x]|x\in X\}$ forms a partition of $X$.

**Conversely**:
Every partition of a set $X$ gives rise to an equivalence relation.

**Theorem**
Let $\mathscr {S}$ be a partition of $X$. Define a relation $R$ on $X$ by $xRy$ if $x$ and $y$ belong to the same member of $\mathscr {S}$. The $R$ is an equivalence relation.
