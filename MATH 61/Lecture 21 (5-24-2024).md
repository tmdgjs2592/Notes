# Graph Theory Cont

Lemma: Suppose G is a graph. Then $$\sum_{v\in V(G)} \delta(v) = 2\cdot |E(G)| $$
Theorem: The number of vertices of odd degree in a graph G is even.

Paths: Given a graph G = (V(G), E(G)), a path from $v\in V(G)$ to $w \in V(G)$ is a sequence ($v_0, e_1, v_1, e_2, v_2, e_3, v_3 ,..., e_n, v_n$)

Definition: A graph G is connected if for any vertices $v,w \in V(G)$, there exists a path from v to w.
The pieces of a graph G are called the componenets. A connected graph has one piece.

Definition: Given a graph G, a subgraph of G is a graph G', such that $V(G') \subseteq V(G) \text{ and } E(G') \subseteq E(G)$, and if there is an edge between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in G', then there is a nedge between $v_1$ and $v_2$ in G.

Definition: Let G be a graph and let $v\in V(G)$. Then, the subgrapgh G' consisting of all edges and vertices contained in some path beginning at $v$ is called the components of G containing v. G is connected if it only has one component.

Definition: A cycle in a graph G is a path of positive length from vertect to itself, with no repeated edges. (Ex: triangle)
Loop: (4, e7, 4)

Definition: The cycle $C_n$ for $n\in \mathbb Z_{>0}$ consists of n vertices and n edges arranged in a loop.
*$C_n$ is bipertile if and only if n is even.*

Theorem: A graph G is bipertile if and only if G contains no odd cycles.
