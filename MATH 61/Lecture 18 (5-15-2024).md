**Probability Cont**
With all outcomes equally likely, $$P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|\Omega|}$$Ex: Consider the experiment of rolling a fair 6-sided die twice, and recording the sequence of faces seen. Then, the count of all possible outcomes is 36.

Independence of events
Def: Events $E_1, E_2$ are independent if $P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1)P(E_2)$ 
Intuition: events are independent if knowing that $E_1$ occurs tells us nothing about whether $E_2$ occurs.
