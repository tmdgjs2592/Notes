How to tell if two graphs are isomorphic
Lemma
G and G' are isomorphic if and only if there exist orderings of their vertices so that the corresponding adjacency matrices are equal

$\underline{\text{If G isom to G', then the adjacency matrices will be equal for some orderings, }}$ 
$\underline{\text{but not necessarily for all orderings.}}$

Isomorphic graphs have the same number of edges.
Isomorphic graphs have the same degree of vertices.

Corollary
If G is isomorphic to G', then G and G' have the same degree sequence.

Converse is not true
Just because G and G' have the same degree sequence, does not mean they are isomorphic.

**Invariants**
def: An invariant is a function whose domain is the set of all graphs, such that I(G) = I(G') if G and G' are isomorphic.
*Useful for proving that 2 graphs are not isomorphic*

Ex:
1. The number of vertices of G
2. The number of edges
3. Whether G is a simple graph
4. Whether G is connected
5. # of connected componenents.
6. The degree sequence of G
7. Whether G has a cycle
8. The # of simple cycles of length n, n>0
9. Whether G has a Euler cycle
10. Whether G has a Hamiltonian cycle
11. Whether G is bipartite
