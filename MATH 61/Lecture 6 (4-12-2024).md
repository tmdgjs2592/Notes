# Connections between bijection and cardinality
Two finite sets X and Y have the same cardinality if and only if $\exists$ a bijection $f: X \rightarrow Y$ 

**Inifite Sets**
1. $|X| \leq |Y|$ iff $f: X\rightarrow Y$ is injective
2. $|X| \geq |Y|$ iff $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is surjective
3. $|X| = |Y|$ iff $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is bijective

*Fact: If $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is bijective, $\exists$ $g: Y \rightarrow X$ that is bijective*

Ex:
|$\mathbb Z$|  = |$\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$| since $\exists$ some bijection $f: \mathbb Z \rightarrow \mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ 

*There are infinities with different size*
Ex)
Define: $I = \{x \in \mathbb R | 0 < x < 1\}$ 
Claim: |$\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$|  < |$I$|
Proof: 
we have an injection $f: \mathbb Z_{\geq 0} \rightarrow I$ by $f(n) = \frac {1}{n+1}$. 
$\therefore$ |$\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$| $\leq$  |$I$| 
TO show that |$\mathbb Z{\geq 0}$| < |$I$|, It is suffice to show that there is no surjection.
find a value x such that $f^{-1}(x) = \varnothing$ 
Suppose
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(1) &= 0.a_1a_2a_3 \dots \\
f(2) &= 0.b_1b_2b_3 \dots \\
f(3) &= 0.c_1c_2c_3 \dots 
\end{aligned}
$$
construct $x = 0.x_1x_2x_3 \dots$ 
choose $x_1$ such that $x_1 \neq a_1$, $x_2 \neq b_2$, $x_3 \neq c_3$ and continue up to $x_n \neq nth$ digit of $f(n)$.
Then, $x \in I$ but $f(n) \neq x$, which means $f^{-1}(x) = \varnothing$ and $f$ is not surjective.

# Countably Infinite
A set $A$ is countably infinite if $|A| = |\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}|$. It is uncountably infinite if $|A| = |I|$.
