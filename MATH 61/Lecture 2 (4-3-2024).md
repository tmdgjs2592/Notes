Recall: 
Induction is a proof technique for proving sequence of statements all at once, usually related in one way.

# Ex: Prove that $n! \geq 2^n$  for all integers $n\geq 4$  
Proof: proceed by induction

$\textbf{Base case: }$
we want to show that $4! \geq 2^4$ 
$4! = 24$ and $2^4 = 16$ so the statement holds true

$\textbf{Inductive step:}$  
Suppose $n! \geq 2^n$  for some $n\geq4$, in order to show that $(n+1)! \geq 2^{n+1}$ 
Notice: $(n+1)! = (n+1) \cdot n! \geq (n+1) \cdot 2^n$ by the inductive hypothesis ($n!\geq2^n$)
Since $n\geq4$, $n+1\geq 5 > 2$  
Therefore, $(n+1)2^n \geq 2\cdot 2^n =2^{n+1}$
Since we have $(n+1)! \geq (n+1)\cdot 2^n$, this completes the proof.
