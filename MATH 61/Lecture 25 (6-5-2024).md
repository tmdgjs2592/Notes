# Isomorphism

**Invariants**
Just because I(G) = I(G'), does not imply G and G' are isomorphic

Non-example of an invariant: The number of crossings in some drawing of G is not an invariant.

**Planar graphs**
Def: A graph G is planar if it can be drawn in the plane in such a way that no two edges cross
Just because a graph G is drawn with some edges crossing, does not necesarily mean that it is not planar.

Def: Suppose we have drawn G in the plan with no edges crossing. Then the drawing of G divides the plane into regions called faces

Def: Given a drawing of some planar graph G, define
$$e_G = V_G - E_G +F_G$$
$V_G = |V(G)|, E_G = |E(G)|$
$F_G$ = # faces in the drawing of G
$e_G$ is called the euler number of the drawing of G

Theorem (Euler's formula)
For any connected planar graph G and any drawing of G in the plane without crossings, we have 
$$e_G = V_G - E_G + F_G = 2$$
Proof idea:
Basically induction, with the base case being G = one vertex.
Inductive step:
Suppose G is a planar graph, and draw it in the plane.
study what happens when you contract an edge of G (delete).
Loop
- face and edge decrease by one
- Then $e_G$ is preserved
Non-loop edge
- num of vertices and edges decrease by one
- Then $e_G$ is preserved

Q: given some graph G, how do we tell if G is planar ?
def: Given a drawing of a planar graph G and a face f of the drawing, the degree of f is the number of sides of edges which touch f.
