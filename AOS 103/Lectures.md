Salinity
Measure salinity by conductivity
denoted S
units of g/kg or practical salinity units (psu)
 salinity is the largest near the subtropics because evaporation happens the most
 
total salt in a mass m: $\sum = mS$ with $m=\rho V$ 

the only surface changes of salt are due to freshwater fluxes: precipitation and evaporation

inputs from river (non negligible)

$$F = \rho u S, F= \frac{Q}{A}$$
Pressure (force per unit area)
units of $N/m^2$ or $kg/m/s^2$

10000 kg / m^3 * m /s^2
kg/m^2/s^2

hydrostatic pressure = weight of water at the depth

flow goes east because of rotation

salinity increases with depth near the pole because it gets more dense 

Potential Density
$$\sigma = \rho (S\theta p_{atmosphere}) - 1000kg/m^3$$
To compare density, bring the parcels to the same pressure.

Pressure is not useful for defining a water mass because pressure does not differ on the surface of ocean.
