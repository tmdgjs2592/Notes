Conservative GC
- Usually, Compiler records roots, object layouts, 
- Conservative GC instead records approximation of what compiler records
- used in C++, C (languages that do not utilize GC)

How to use one word to implement doubly linked list
- instead of using prev and next, we put one variable that is prev^next
	- ex: b's pointer would have a ^ c (a xor c)
	- to move to the next:
```C++
a^(*b) = a^a^c = c
```

Generation-based copying collector (Java)

GC with multiple threads
-  If two threads access the same memory and create objects, can be hazard
	- give each thread its own nursery
- GC gets its own thread (tricky)

Object Oriented Languages
- OO language $\neq$ OO programming
- OO world has many variations
	- static vs dynamic type checking
	- classes vs something else 
		- classes: instantiation, inheritance, types, namespaces 

OO Implementation of methods
```
o.m(a,b) looks like 
m(o,a,b) at machine level code
```

**Errors**
Ways to address errors
- Static checking (most reliable but not powerful enough to address subscript errors)
- Dynamic checking, if it fails
	- terminate programs
	- throw exception 
	- substitute some valid behavior
- Undefined behavior C/C++/etc
	- bad reliability
	- better performance
- Total definition
- Throwing exceptions
