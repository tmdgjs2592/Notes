SIMD: Single Instruction/Multiple Data, computing method that enables processing of multiple data with a single instruction.
MIMD: Multiple Instruction/Multiple Data, processing multiple data in parallel using multiple decoders.

Problems for using C++
* They wanted cheap CPUs
* Too unreliable, pointers and etc
	* Manual delete and free memory
* Expensive executables
* Too complicated

Small talk (Xerox PARC)
- Language made by Xerox PARC
- Object Oriented programming language (C++)
- Dynamically typed (Unlike C++)
- Portable
	- Small talk represents the program in machine-independent way
	- Bytecodes run on any machine
	- Solves the problem of cheap CPUs, because the program runs on any CPUs.
	- Solves the issue of expensive executables because bytecodes are more compact
- Interpreter does subscript checking (nullptr, etc)
	- Throws well defined error instead of undefined error.
	- Solves the reliability issue of C++
- Garbage Collector that handles memory
	- Solves the reliability issue of C++
	- It slows down the program since it has to keep track of the memory
Problem of Small talk
- Not as much network as we'd like
- No parallelism
	- Built on a single CPU machine
- Dynamic type checking
- Odd syntax

They made a new language that has the advantages of Smalltalk but fixes the problems $\rightarrow$ Java (It was originally Oak:Object Application Kernel but It was already trade marked. They spun the globe and picked one spot and it was called java)

**Java Basics**
- Variables are always initialized
- Primitive types are machine-independent
	- byte short int long will have the same bits across all machines
	- They use only 2's complement
- Reference type objects
- Order of evaluation is always from left to right
- Single inheritance language
	- A class can only inherit from one superclass.
- No preprocessor
	- Ex:
```c++
#include
#define
#ifdef
```
* no delete operation
* no pointers

**Arrays (Reference Types)**
```Java
int[] arr = new int[1000]
```
- arrays live only on the heap, never on the stack

**Inheritance**
- Parents/child relationship
- final keywords prevent overriding and improve speed
```Java
class C{
	final int m(){return 1;}
}
class D extends C{
	int m () {return 2;} # not valid
}
```
- abstract: obligation to subclasses to implement such function
```Java
class C{
	abstract int n ();
}
class D extends C{
	int n() {n++;}
}
```
* Interface: abstract class 
	* Way to inherit multiple classes for Java
```Java
 interface I{
	int m();
	int n(float i);
	void run();
 }
```
- Thread
	- Thread objects represents a single thread of computation in a SMP-like environment.
	- MIMD (One instruction pointer per thread)
	- SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing)
		- All CPUs can access the object
	- run() is an abstract function (has to be implemented)
```Java
Thread t = new Thread();
``` 
* Thread's life cycle
	* Creation via new 
	* t.start() allocate OS resources
	* Thread can
		* sleep $\rightarrow$ TIMEDWAITING
		* wait $\rightarrow$ WAITING
		* do I/O $\rightarrow$ BLOCKED
		* run ordinary code $\rightarrow$ RUNNABLE
		* yield() $\rightarrow$ RUNNABLE
