Hardware traps:
when you get a rounding error, exception_handler gets called

how is exception handling built?
you have a module A that tries some code
code has to be able to figure out the dynamic chain (its callers) and the catching code.

-_attribute_-((noexcept)): signal that the function won't throw an exception

**Exception handling**
- hurt performance of CPU-intensive code
- static checking to prevent common errors
	- Java (Checked exceptions): methods declare in their signatures which exceptions they might throw.

Rust and exception handling
- panic("ouch"); : prints backtrace, unwinds the stack, cleaning up as it goes

Parameter passing
- call by value: caller evaluates args, passes copies of values to callee
	- inefficient when dealing with large data
- call by reference: caller evaluates args for their addresses.
	- can confuse programmers and compilers because names don't matter anymore.
	- casues your code to be slower
	- aliasing
- call by result (less often): callee sets var, pass result back on return
- call by value-result: call by value + call by result 
- macro calls: (done statically)
- call by unification (Prolog)
- call by name: functions :: call by reference : pointers
- call by need: call by name except the expressions are evaluated at most once.

Speeding up parameter passing and calls (call by value)
- costs of a call
	- caller: evaluate all arguments (one hidden arg: return address)
	- copy arg values to parameter values
	- jump to procedure start
	- callee: allocate frame 
	- save registers as needed
	- do work
	- copy results to result location 
	- restore registers
	- deallocate frame
	- jump back to caller
- Tail Recursion Optimization (TRO)
- C++ inline
	- bad recursion

Cost Models
- Mental model of resources needed to run

What costs?
- CPU/GPU time
- Real time
- RAM/Cache
- data reliability
- human developer time
- energy
- Power
- network
