**Higher Level stuff from programming languages**
Contents for variables
- Compilers (or us) decide about registers vs RAM
- System decides on cache

Machine code (instruction pointer must point at something)
- library code (pre-written code, developers can use to perform common tasks without having to write the code from scratch)
- interpreter (translates code into a machine-readable format on the fly)
- instruction pointer (ip) lives in a register but saved ip needs to live somewhere (ip indicates where a computer is in its program sequence. It points to the next instruction to be executed)
- return address (the address of the next instruction following the function call is saved on the stack)
- multiple threads (Each thread has its own instruction pointer)

I/O Buffers
* When you print, the output is saved in RAM before it's actually output

Persistent storage
we have persistent varaible in java but why ?

Higher Level need categories:
Static Storage
- Figures out allocation of all variables before the program runs
- Simple and can be optimized based on the knowledge of locations
- However, security issues since attackers know where everything is
- You cannot allocate new memory like malloc or new.
- No recursion (STACK solves this issue)

Stack for calling and returning from functions
* call to push return address 
* pop to come back to return address
* fast allocation and freeing
* limited order of freeing storage
	* Last In First Out

Variants of Stack idea: C - activation record
- storage allocated when you enter a function and freed when you return from the function
- computes the size statically per function

C99
- Storage dynamically allocated $\rightarrow$ more flexible allocation and good for array application
- Security issues: Stack overflow
```C
int f(int n){
	int arr[n+3];
	return g (buf, n, arr);
}
Issues when n = INT_MAX (Overflow) and INT_MIN (negative)
```

Alpha: Nested function
To access non-local variables, you need two pointers: instruction pointer and environment pointer.
Dynamic chain points from an activation record to its caller
Another chain that points to its definer 
If g is a function inside f, this chain will point to f
OCaml requires a closure since it has to support nested functions (currying)

**Heap management**
- Not restricted to LIFO
- More expenive and complicated than the stack
- How to keep track of where the objects are in the heap
	- In many systems, this is applicatoin's responsibility
- How to keep track of free spaces
	- Memory management system must do this
- runts: tiny little free areas
- Go through the free list and see if the object can be coalesced to free areas near
- To speed up coalescing, use quick lists for commonly-requested size
	- Choose commonly requested sizes
	- Treat them specially and have a separate list for them
	- If the list is non-empty, use the first one on the list for free space
	- else, full malloc algorithm
	- To free, instead of calling free(p), put it back on the separate list
App's responsibility to recognized and free objects when needed is error-prone because
1. It can misclassify and forget to free $\rightarrow$ slower performance
2. It can mistakenly free an object $\rightarrow$ dangling pointer 
	- can lead to security issues as the behavior is undefined
Standard, common fix: Garbage Collector
- Idea: app does not explicitly free anything
- memory manager frees/reallocates memory $\rightarrow$ fixes (2) and helps (1) but not all cases since the program may have an instance of the pointer

Standard GC algorithm: Mark + Sweep algorithm
1. Mark phase. mark bits of all objects are initialized to 0. Mark objects 1 if it's reachable. Start looking at objects directly pointed at by program variables. Then, recursively mark each object or objects that it points at.
2. Sweep phase. Add each unmarked object to the free list.

How does GC know where program variables are?
- Compiler creates tables or code that list where the program variables are
- Stack, static storage, or registers
- Also GC needs to know the layout of each heap object

C/C++ use free/del which is faster but more buggier
C/C++ uses conservative GC: Less info required
