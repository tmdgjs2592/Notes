**Green threads**
- Energy efficient
- Only one core running at any given time (one computation)

set!: assigining variables

**Errors in Scheme (4 categories)**
- Implementation restriction (memory exhausted)
- Unspecified behavior 
- An error is signaled
	- (eg: open-input-file "f": this code has to signal an error if the file f is not found)
- Undefined behavior
	- (eg: car 23: it can do anything it wants to do)

Scheme Memory Management
- Fortrom (Static only)
	- NO exhaustion at runtime
	- Fast code
	- No recursion
	- Inflexible: waste memory or can't run
- Stack
	- Static frame size
	- Dynamic frame size
	- nested function
		- Calling convention: every function has extra argument (address of definer's frame)
- Heap
	- Last in anybody out
	- Slower than stack
	- Heap manager must manage discontinuous sets of objects 
	- Approach: let program allocate and free objects as needed
	- manager only keeps track of free spaces, using free list
		- simple
		- fragmentation error
		- dangling pointers: pointer that points to an object that's no longer there
		- memory leak (programmer forgets to free objects)
		- Long free list
	- Grabage collection
		- don't let the programmer create dangling pointers or memory leaks
		- chews up resources and memory 
		- uses mark + sweep algorithm
			- simple
			- freezes program
			- Cost is O(Nobjects)

**Python storage management**
- reference counts (count how many pointers point to each object)
- when that count is zero, free the object
-
