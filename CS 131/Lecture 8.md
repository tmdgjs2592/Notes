**Subtypes & Generics**
```java
void printall(Collection<?> c)
```
The syntax ? allows you to instantiate the generic type.
```java
u super T 
```
u has to be a supertype of T (or T extends u).

**Generic types at runtime**

**Duck typing**
- look at what object does, not what it is.

**Scope**
- Scope of a name is the set of program locations where the name is visible.

**Java**
