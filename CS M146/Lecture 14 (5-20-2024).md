# K Means

Properties:
- it's fairly quick to converge
- It converges eventually

**K-means++ (for your own knowledge)**

Choosing K
- Increasing K will always decrease the optimal value of the K-Means objective
- Information cirteria to penalize for large K
	- AIC: $J_K +2K$ 
	- BIC: $J_K +K log(N)$ 

Median is more robust to outliers

diff between GMM and Clusterign
- Soft vs Hard assignment
- Covariance and mean

Hyperparameters: num of clusters k
Robustness: K-median
Soft clustering: GMM (Probabilistic interpretation of K-Means)
