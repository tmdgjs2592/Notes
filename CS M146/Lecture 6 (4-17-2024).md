# Decision Trees

For real number $\rightarrow$ we need a threshold

**Occam's razor**
- Make the solution as simple as possible, but "no simple"
- Simplicity related to size
- $\#$ of nodes, $\#$ of leaves

**ID3 Algorithm**
$\rightarrow$ information maximizing greedy approach.

Measure of uncertainty $\rightarrow$ entropy
*Entropy of a discrete valued random variable is maximum for a uniform distribution max entropy = $\log|X|$*
$$H(L|F) = \text{conditional entropy} = \sum_k P(F=a_k) \cdot H(L|F=a_k)$$
*If uncertainty goes down, information is gained*
$$GAIN = H[Y] - H[Y|F]$$
