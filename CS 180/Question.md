preferences = $[[2,1,3],[0,3,2],[1,0,3],[2,0,1]]$
pairs = $[[0,1],[2,3]]$ 
outcome = 2

preferences = $[[1,3,2],[2,3,0],[1,0,3],[1,0,2]]$ 
pairs = $[[2,1],[3,0]]$ 
outcome = 0

In the first case, 2 is unhappy because 2 prefers person 1 over person 3 (current partner) but person 1 prefers person 0.
In the second case, shouldn't 3 be unhappy too because 3 prefers 1 but 1 prefers 2.
