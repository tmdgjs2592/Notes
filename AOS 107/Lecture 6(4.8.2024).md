Sunlight in water
Light intensity decreases quickly with depth
$$
I_Z = I_0e^{-kz}
$$
the wavelength changes with depth and the color gets bluer.
# Measuring Light
- Secchi Disk
- PAR meter --cosine or scalar
- Beam Transmissionmeter (beam-c)
Mantis Shrimp
- Extraordinary photo receptive eyes
- 16 photoreceptors
# Plant Anatomy
Chloroplasts
- Light energy is captured and converted in chloroplasts
Cyanobacteria
- not as well as primary photosynthesis producer
- they do have membrane that does photosynthesis
